OVERVIEW
--------
CHAGent is a pipeline that turns Natural Language Access Control Requirements
(NLACPs) into structured Access Control Policies (ACPs). An ACP is a list of
Access Control Rules (ACRs); each ACR is a dictionary with six fields:

    decision  (allow | deny)
    subject   action   resource   purpose   condition

The pipeline has three modules, each evaluated independently:

  1. Identification (artifact/identification/)

  2. Generation (artifact/generation/)

  3. Validation (artifact/validation/)

REQUIREMENTS
------------
See infrastructure/README.txt for full details. In short:
  - Linux with an NVIDIA CUDA GPU (A100 with >= 40 GB VRAM recommended for LLaMa-3-8B).
  - Python 3.12 (tested with 3.12.13).
  - A HuggingFace account with access to the gated model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.

INSTALLATION
------------
  bash install.sh                 # creates ./.venv and installs everything
  source .venv/bin/activate

  # Authenticate for the gated LLaMa-3 base model (choose one):
  huggingface-cli login
  export HF_TOKEN=<your_token>

  # Optional but recommended: point the HF cache at a large disk
  export HF_HOME=/path/with/space/huggingface

TEST DATA (already included under artifact/data/ — no download needed)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  document_folds/<fold>.csv       Identification test data (columns: input, acp, output)
  document_folds/<fold>_acp.csv   Generation eval data    (columns: input, output[, origin])
  verification/{utrain,uval,utest}.csv  Validator data (labels 0-11)

  Folds/datasets: t2p, acre, ibm, collected, cyber, overall (+ misc store).

PRETRAINED CHECKPOINTS (download; ~20 GB total)
-----------------------------------------------
Checkpoints are hosted under https://huggingface.co/chagent-artifacts:
  chagent-artifacts/chagent-generation     generators (<dataset>_act/<seed>/checkpoint,
                                            seeds 2,3,4) + verification/checkpoint
  chagent-artifacts/chagent-verification    seed-2 BART validator (2/checkpoint)
  chagent-artifacts/chagent-identification  identifiers (single seed)

Fetch and arrange them into the exact paths the scripts expect with:

    ./download_checkpoints.sh

RUNNING THE MODULES (run each script from its OWN directory)
------------------------------------------------------------
Run ./download_checkpoints.sh first (see above), then evaluate any module:

  # 1. Identification (evaluate a fold)
  cd artifact/identification
  python evaluate_classification.py --mode=collected --seed=0

  # 2. Verifier (evaluate on the held-out test set)
  cd artifact/validation
  python eval_test.py

  # 3. End-to-end CHAGent evaluation (DSARCP, with refinement)
  cd artifact/generation/evaluation
  python eval_chagent.py --mode=cyber --result_dir="results/sarcp" --k=3 --seed=2 --refine

The self-contained runners under claims/ wrap these — see "RUNNING THE
EXPERIMENTS" below.

RUNNING THE EXPERIMENTS (claim -> artifact mapping)
---------------------------------------------------
Each of the paper's experiments has a self-contained runner under claims/ that
exercises the corresponding module on the PROVIDED checkpoints (no training
needed). Each claims/<n>/claim.txt states which paper section/table/figure the
experiment maps to, and each run prints results in the format shown in
claims/<n>/expected/.

  claims/claim1_generation/run.sh       end-to-end DSARCP generation
  claims/claim2_validation/run.sh       policy validator evaluation
  claims/claim3_ablation/run.sh         retrieval/post-process/refinement ablation
  claims/claim4_identification/run.sh   NLACP identification, per fold

How to run a claim:
  First `source .venv/bin/activate` and run ./download_checkpoints.sh (once).
  Then invoke a runner with bash — it can be launched from ANY directory (each
  script locates the repo and cd's into the right module itself):
      bash claims/claim4_identification/run.sh
  Environment overrides work from anywhere too, e.g.:
      DATASETS=ibm SEEDS=3 bash claims/claim1_generation/run.sh
  (Use bash, not sh — the runners rely on bash features.)

Checkpoints (run ./download_checkpoints.sh first — see above):
  - Generation: every dataset x seeds {2,3,4}
      (artifact/generation/checkpoints/<mode>_act_<seed>/checkpoint)
  - Validation: the seed-2 checkpoint, at
      artifact/validation/checkpoints/verification/checkpoint   (Claim 2) and
      artifact/generation/checkpoints/verification/checkpoint   (Claims 2 & 4)
  - Identification: seed 0 per dataset, from the chagent-identification repo, at
      artifact/identification/checkpoints/<mode>_0/checkpoint

Generation runs (Claims 2 & 4):
  The generation runner can be run per seed (seeds 2, 3, 4); each run prints its
  own SARCP F1 and ACR-Generation F1. The paper reports the mean/SD over the
  three seeds, aggregated externally — see claims/claim1_generation/claim.txt for
  the interactive scope prompt and the time cost of running all seeds.

Note on seed coverage (single-seed checkpoints for two modules):
  Generation ships all three seeds (2, 3, 4). For identification (Claim 4) and
  validation (Claim 2) a single representative-seed checkpoint is published. These runs exercise
  the module and demonstrate the reported behaviour on that seed. For reference,
  the per-seed evaluation logs for the validator's seeds 0/1/2 are included under
  claims/claim2_validation/eval_logs/.

NOTE ON SECRETS
---------------
Do NOT hardcode HuggingFace tokens in scripts. Pass them via the HF_TOKEN
environment variable or `huggingface-cli login`.
